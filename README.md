## Overview

A complete weather monitoring solution built specifically for astronomical observatories and remote telescope installations. This project provides everything needed to build and deploy a professional-grade weather station at a fraction of commercial costs.

Originally developed to support the ROTSE-III Namibia telescope revival project, but designed as a general-purpose solution for the global astronomy community.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Sensor Suite**: Temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed.
- **3D Printable Design**: Weatherproof enclosure and mounting hardware
- **Remote Monitoring**: Web interface with real-time data display
- **Data Logging**: CSV/JSON export with API access
- **Solar Power Ready**: Designed for off-grid installations
- **Robust Construction**: Built to withstand harsh outdoor environments

## Hardware Design

The weather station features a modular design with a weatherproof 3D printed enclosure. All components are easily accessible for maintenance while providing excellent protection against the elements.

## Quick Start

1. **Hardware**: Print the enclosure parts and assemble with components from the BOM
2. **Software**: Flash the firmware and configure your WiFi settings
3. **Deploy**: Mount securely and connect to your observatory network
4. **Monitor**: Access the web interface for real-time data and historical logs
